== DESCRIPTION:

CookieCrumbs is a Rails plugin that adds the ability to store more than 
one value for a single cookie. This is helpful in applications that 
need to store more than the maximum 20 allowed cookies.


== SYNOPSIS:

CookieCrumbs provides both Rails and Javascript code needed to set cookies so
that you can easily trade information between client and server side actions. 

=== In a Rails Controllers

The plugin will add a new method to your controller classes to access the 
crumbs. 

  def index
    # setting crumbs - these all save to the same 'widget' cookie
    crumbs[:widget] = { :favorites => "open", :sources => "closed" }
    # or
    crumbs[:widget][:favorites] = "open"
    crumbs[:widget][:sources]   = "closed"

    # getting crumbs
    crumbs[:widget] # => { :favorites => "open", :sources => "closed" }
    crumbs[:widget][:favorites] # => "open"

    # deleting crumbs
    crumbs[:widget].delete :favorites
  end


=== In the Javascript

The javascript library extends the document object with various methods for
manipulating both cookies and crumbs. 

  // cookies (set/get/delete)
  document.setCookie('sidebar', 'open');
  document.getCookie('sidebar');
  document.delCookie('sidebar');

  // setting crumbs - these all save to the same 'widget' cookie
  document.setCrumb('widget', 'favorites' 'open');
  document.setCrumb('widget', 'sources'   'closed');

  // getting crumbs
  document.getCrumb('widget', 'favorites'); // => "open"

  // deleting crumbs
  document.delCrumb('widget', 'sources');


== REQUIREMENTS:

The Prototype Library (http://prototype.conio.net) is required for the 
javascript crumb code to work. 


== INSTALL:

=== The Plugin

  $ ./script/plugin install http://svn.mikenaberezny.com/public/rails/plugins/cookie_crumbs
  
If you are upgrading from a previous version, update your application
javascripts with:

  rake cookie_crumbs:install

=== Including the javascript file

The javascript portion of this library is not required for the rails portion
to work. It is based on the Prototype library and can be added to your
application using the usual helpers. 

  <%= javascript_include_tag 'prototype', 'cookie_crumbs %>
